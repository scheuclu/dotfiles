# dotfiles

## Structure
This repository contains all my linux configuration files, except vim.
For vim, I have a separate repository.

The repository contains the following dotfiles:
 - .bashrc
 - tmux.conf
 - .gmshrc
 - .hgrc
 
## Usage
The respository is supposed to be put under/home/<username>/dotfiles.
  
After cloning, the links can easily be created using the script "create_symlinks.sh".
